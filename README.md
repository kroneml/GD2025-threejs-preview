# Visualizing Jonas’s Life in Dark on a 360° Display

This is an [online demo](https://kroneml.github.io/GD2025-threejs-preview/) for our submission to the [Creative Topic](https://mozart.diei.unipg.it/gdcontest/2025/creative/) of the [Graph Drawing 2025](https://graphdrawing.github.io/gd2025/) [Contest](https://mozart.diei.unipg.it/gdcontest/2025/). The task was to create a visualization of the event graph of the Netflix series *Dark* for the [Nörrkoping Decision Arena](https://liu.se/en/research/norrkoping-decision-arena), which features a 12,288 x 1,200 pixel 360-degree display.
